	<h2>
		<a href="#1" id="1">1. INTRODUCTION</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Algeria is a game simulating the conflict between the <i>Front de Liberation Nationale</i> (FLN) Arab
		nationalist guerrillas and the French government from 1954 to 1962. During the game, the FLN Player tries to
		erode the authority of the French colonial authorities and replace their governing structures with his own, to the point
		that Algeria makes the transition to national independence.</p>

	<h2>
		<a href="#2" id="2">2. GAME COMPONENTS AND CONCEPTS</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		The game contains the following: 140 counters, one 17x22" area movement map of Algeria and area, these rules,
		and several pages of Charts and Tables. You will also need several six-sided dice. In the game, the
		abbreviation '?d6' refers to the sum of the roll of one or more dice, where ? is the number to roll, and DRM
		means Die Roll Modifier: add or subtract the required amount to the die or dice rolled. Unless otherwise
		stated, all DRM are cumulative.

	<h3>
		<a href="#2.1" id="2.1">2.1 COUNTERS</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		Most of the 140 counters in the game represent small or large military or paramilitary formations. Units are
		also differentiated between static (FLN Fronts and Government Police: represented by icons) and mobile
		(FLN Cadres, Bands and Faileks, all Government regular, elite and Algerian units: represented by the "box"
		NATO symbology system) types. Mobile units have their Evasion (for FLN) or Contact (for Government) rating
		printed to the left of the symbol box, while the Firepower rating is printed underneath the symbol
		box. Static units have one number, which is their Firepower and Contact or Evasion rating, printed
		underneath their icon. See the Unit Identification Table for more details.

	<h3>
		<a href="#2.2" id="2.2">2.2 MAP</a>
	</h3>

	<!-- TODO insert diagram -->
	<p>The map is an abstracted representation of Algeria, divided into areas. Urban areas (large cities) are named; all
		non-urban areas have the name of a large town and a number code to correspond with the <i>wilaya</i> or zone
		system the FLN command structure used (so area V-1 is the first sector in <i>wilaya</i> 5). Each area has a set
		of boxes to hold units.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Underground (UG) box.</b>
			All FLN units begin the turn in the UG boxes.
			They are mostly safe from enemy interference here, but can be moved out by successful
			Intelligence missions (<a href="#9.24">9.24</a>).
			Government units do not use this box.

		<li><b>Operations (OPS) box.</b>
			FLN mobile units deploy here from the UG box of
			the same Area. After they conduct a mission, they are placed in the OC box. Government mobile units begin
			the turn in this box, in anticipation of conducting missions in the Deployment and Operations Phases.

		<li><b>Operations Completed (OC) box.</b>
			Units go to this box for several reasons: units are placed here after conducting a mission,
			including FLN units that arrived in the area after conducting a Movement mission elsewhere; or if
			Government unit is not activated in the Reinforcement Phase (<a href="#6.32">6.32</a>);
			or if FLN units are contacted in an Intelligence mission (<a href="#9.24">9.24</a>).

		<li><b>Patrol (PTL) box.</b>
			Government units here are assumed to be guarding installations, patrolling the streets, etc.. Units
			in a PTL box have a negative effect on most enemy missions conducted in their area. Government
			Police units are always in this box. Government mobile units may also be placed here in the Deployment
			Phase. They conduct Flush or React missions during the Operations Phase, but if they do they are now "off
			Patrol" and will enter the OC box on completing the mission.

		<li><b>Rating.</b>
			Each Area has a letter after its name to show its rating. The Rating of an Area sometimes determines
			what kinds of missions may be conducted in it. The area may have a U or R marking it as Urban or
			Remote: otherwise it is judged to be Rural. Note: Urban areas are considered to be part of the
			<i>wilaya</i> they are located in.
	</ul>

	<p>There are several other non-area areas shown on the map:
	<ul>
		<li><b>France.</b>
			This box represents the country; only the FLN player may send units there, to perform only
			Propaganda missions. See <a href="#11.22">11.22</a>.

		<li><b>Morocco, Tunisia and the Border Zone Track.</b>
		<li>These two countries gained their independence from France during the time of the conflict, and after this
			event both promptly became sanctuaries for the FLN to train, organize and equip its forces. The two
			countries become independent due to a random event during the game (or, as an optional rule, they
			will become independent some time during the first 6 turns). When this happens, the FLN player may use
			these countries for certain missions, and the Government player, who may not enter these
			countries, may instead fortify the Border Zone to interfere with FLN forces entering Algeria from either
			country. See <a href="#11.22">11.22</a>.
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a href="#2.3" id="2.3">2.3 GAME CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Here are explanations of several administrative and political concepts represented in the game:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Administrative Points (AP):</b> The FLN player needs these to continue his struggle. APs usually stand
			for time spent planning or training, expenditure of ammunition, explosives, etc.. APs can be saved
			from turn to turn but are subject to Depreciation if hoarded (<a href="#10.11">10.11</a>).
			They are recorded on the Record Track.

		<li>
			<b>Control:</b> This is an abstraction of which player commands more power in a given Area, in the sense
			that he dominates both its physical space (lines of communication, control of movement) and
			psychological space (support or at least acquiescence of the local population, and/or acceptance
			of the player's control of physical space).
			An Area can be Controlled by one side or the other (a Control marker in the appropriate colour is placed
			anywhere in the area) or Contested (no marker present). Control is important to FLN as a source of AP,
			and the player who controls more Areas than the other can gain PSP (see the PSL Adjustment Summary table).

		<li>
			<b>Government:</b> This term is used to denote collectively the forces controlled by the player representing
			the Government of France. It includes Algerian mobile and Police units, the French regular army,
			and French elite forces. Where one nationality is affected by a rule of the game, it is
			mentioned specifically.

		<li>
			<b>Neutralization:</b> Units may become neutralized for a number of reasons
			(see <a href="#9.14">9.14</a>, <a href="#9.15">9.15</a>, <a href="#9.22">9.22</a>, <a href="#9.23">9.23</a>,
			<a href="#9.26">9.26</a>).
			This is denoted by it having a NEUT marker placed on top of it
			(Police units have NEUT printed on the backs of their counters, to save on markers; just flip them
			over when this happens to them). A neutralized unit may not perform any missions while in this
			state, neither does it count for control of an area. It may fire back on the Combat Results Table if
			fired upon.

		<li>
			<b>Political Support Level (PSL):</b> Political Support Levels represent different things to the two
			players. For the FLN, it is the level of popular support or commitment the Arab population of Algeria is
			willing to
			give it (as opposed to other political movements or methods) as the agent of change in the struggle
			against the French. For the French, it is a measure of the political will of the government in Paris
			to continue expending resources to fight the war.
			<p>
				PSLs are measured in Political Support Points (PSP) and change constantly during the course of the game
				depending on events. Consult the PSL Adjustments Summary in the Charts and Tables to see why, and
				when, and by how much. The highest level is 99 and the lowest is 0. If either player's PSL reaches
				0 at any point in the game, he is deemed to have reached the point of political collapse for his side
				and the game ends (historically, this was in early 1962 when the two sides reached a ceasefire and
				plan for Algerian independence under the Evian Accords). See <a href="#12">12.0</a>.
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<a href="#3" id="3">3. SETTING UP THE GAME</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Players begin by picking a scenario to play (1954, 1958, or 1960). They then set up units and set markers as
		directed; play begins with the Random Events Phase of the first turn.

	<h2>
		<a href="#4" id="4">4. SEQUENCE OF PLAY</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Each turn represents an indeterminate period of time: usually several months or more. Each turn, the Sequence of
		Play is as follows:

	<ul>
		<li>Random Events Phase
		<li>Reinforcement Phase
		<li>Deployment Phase
		<li>Operations Phase
		<li>Turn Interphase - sequence of segments as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Control / Depreciation Segment
				<li>Recovery Segment
				<li>Redeployment Segment
				<li>Final PSL Adjustment Segment
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>The structure of the rules follows this scheme.

	<h2>
		<a href="#5" id="5">5. RANDOM EVENTS PHASE</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		One player (doesn't matter who) rolls 1d6 twice in succession and treats the first roll as the 'tens' number,
		and
		the second as the 'ones' (so a roll of 4 followed by a 6 would mean random event 46). He consults the
		Random Events Table and applies the result as directed.

	<h2>
		<a href="#6" id="6">6. REINFORCEMENT PHASE</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		In this phase, the FLN player gathers AP from various sources, and expends some of them to Build and Augment his
		units. The Government player expends PSP to mobilize and/or activate static or mobile units. The
		Government player goes first in this phase: however, to save time and by mutual agreement it may
		be conducted simultaneously.

	<h3>
		<a href="#6.1" id="6.1">6.1 FLN SOURCES FOR AP</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The FLN player gets AP from several sources:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Areas under FLN control.</b> He gets 5 AP for each Urban area he controls, or 2 AP if the
			area is contested but he has non-neutralized units there. He gets 2 AP for each Rural area he
			controls, and 1 if the area is contested but he has non-neutralized units there. If an area is Terrorized,
			he gets 1 fewer AP than he normally would.
		<li><b>Random events.</b> The FLN player will occasionally receive shipments of weapons
			(represented by AP) as a result of random event.
		<li><b>The FLN PSL.</b> He gets AP equal to 10% (round fractions up) of his current PSL, minus the
			number of French Naval Points.

			<i class="note">These at-large AP represent casual "taxation" by the FLN organization
				of Muslims in Algeria and expatriates working in France, small arms sales and shipments, etc.
				and their interception by French authorities.</i>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a href="#6.2" id="6.2">6.2 FLN BUILD / CONVERT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		The FLN player may build new Cadres or Bands by spending the AP cost and placing them in the UG box of any area
		which contains a non-Neutralized Front (note that this requires the presence of a Front). New units
		may be given missions in the Operations Phase that turn. The FLN player may also Convert a Cadre to a
		Front or Band, or a Band to a Failek, by spending the indicated cost in AP and swapping the unit for
		the old. Fronts may not be created in Remote areas (not enough people) and there may be only one Front per
		area. Fronts may also convert themselves to Cadres at no cost, but no recovery of AP either. A newly
		converted Front will allow new Cadres or Bands to be built there in the same Reinforcement Phase.

	<h3>
		<a href="#6.3" id="6.3">6.3 GOVERNMENT MOBILIZATION AND ACTIVATION</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		The Government player pays a varying amount of PSP to enter new units from those not currently on the map,
		to activate units that are already there, and to acquire greater numbers of combat assets, represented
		by Points (Air, Helicopter, and Naval). See the Mobilization / Activation Table (round up any odd
		totals of PSP).

	<h4><a href="#6.31" id="6.31">6.31 Mobilization.</a></h4>

	<p>
		Newly mobilized mobile units are placed in the OPS box of any Area, and may be given missions that turn. They do
		not have to be separately activated (<a href="#6.32">6.32</a>).
		Newly mobilized Police units are placed in the PTL box of
		any Area. The Government player may also remove Police units in this Phase (though he does not recover
		any PSP) and may immediately re-mobilize them (for the stated cost in PSP) in another Area. New
		Points are recorded on the Record Track.

	<h4><a href="#6.32" id="6.32">6.32 Activation: mobile units.</a></h4>

	<p>
		French mobile units and the Border Zone Track have to be Activated each turn in order for them to conduct
		missions in the Operations Phase or to interfere with FLN operations. If the Government player does
		not pay the activation cost for a given unit, it is placed in the OC box of its current area. A unit
		that was mobilized just this turn does not also have to be activated.

	<h4><a href="#6.33" id="6.33">6.33 The Border Zone Track.</a></h4>

	<p>
		The Government player will progressively mobilize the Border Zone during the game. He initially mobilizes the
		Border Zone by paying the indicated PSP cost and placing the Status marker on the "0" box of the
		Track. Each turn thereafter he may pay additional PSP to improve the DRM that will apply against FLN
		units attempting to Move across the border with Morocco or Tunisia.
	<p>
		The Government player must also pay each turn to activate the Border Zone. If he does not pay the activation
		cost
		for the Border Zone, the Status marker is flipped over to show "Inactive". If the Border Zone is not
		activated, its DRM will not apply to FLN units moving across the international border.

	<h2>
		<a href="#7" id="7">7. DEPLOYMENT PHASE</a>
	</h2>

	<p>Both players decide what they will do during the upcoming Operations Phase. The Government player goes first.
	<ul>
		<li>The Government player may place any activated mobile units he wishes in the PTL box of
			the unit's same area, or the OPS box of any other area in Algeria, or leave them in the OPS box of the
			same Area. Government mobile units must be in a PTL or OPS box to conduct missions in the Operations Phase.
			At this time, the Government player may also change any of his divisions between Dispersed and
			Concentrated modes (see <a href="#11.7">11.7</a>).
		<li>The FLN player deploys his units from the Underground (UG) box to the Operations (OPS)
			box of the same area at no cost in AP (he may also deploy one Cadre to France, see <a
				href="#11.22">11.22</a>).
			FLN units must be in the OPS box to conduct missions in the Operations Phase.
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<a href="#8" id="8">8. OPERATIONS PHASE</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		In the Operations Phase players can conduct any mission except Patrol. At the beginning of the Phase, and after
		any player performs a mission, the FLN player may:
	<ul>
		<li>perform a mission; OR
		<li>tell the Government player to perform a mission, OR
		<li>pass (do nothing).
	</ul>
	<p>
		When the Government player is told to perform a mission, or if the FLN player passes, the Government player may
		either perform a mission or pass. If both players pass in succession, start the Turn Interphase.
		(Note: the Government player always has a chance to React (<a href="#9.25">9.25</a>) to a FLN player mission,
		and only that mission, just after the FLN player implements the result from that mission and before the players
		move
		on to any other mission.)

	<h2>
		<a href="#9" id="9">9. MISSIONS</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Procedures and requirements for different missions are explained below. Not all missions are available to all
		players. In general, when a player has an opportunity to conduct a mission, the player:
	<ul>
		<li>declares what mission will be conducted with which unit or units;
		<li>pays the appropriate cost in AP or PSP (record this by moving the appropriate marker
			downwards on the Record Track);
		<li>rolls the die and resolves the result against the target units defined by the mission
			selected. Note that in many cases one or both player's PSL may be adjusted, see the PSL Adjustment
			Summary. Certain missions have additional good or bad effects, denoted by @ or + symbols. These
			are implemented in addition to whatever effect the actual number result may have had - there may also
			be a React to resolve;
		<li>after any results and React missions have been implemented, he places the conducting
			unit or units in the Operations Completed (OC) box of that same Area.
	</ul>

		<dd>This mission is designed to raise the FLN or reduce the French PSL. Any PSP gained from the
			Mission Success Table may be added to the FLN or subtracted from the Government PSL in
			any combination.</dd>
		<dt>Additional effects:</dt>
		<dd>On a "+" result, the Cadre is eliminated; a Front is reduced to a Cadre.</dd>

		<dt>Procedure:</dt>
		<dd>The FLN player designates the Front and any Cadres that may be assisting in the mission, pays
			the ? AP cost, and rolls on the Mission Success Table (any Cadres assisting will yield DRM for this
			roll). The FLN player will roll a number of dice equal to the numerical result from the Table,
			yielding a total number of PSP. These may be added to the FLN PSL or subtracted from the Government
			PSL, in any combination. The FLN units are placed in the OC box after any Government React. The
			Government player must React to a Strike with at least 1 unit. There is a penalty of-1d6 PSP if
			he cannot or will not React to it.</dd>
		<dt>Additional effects:</dt>
		<dd>On a "+" result, all FLN units involved in the mission are removed: a Cadre is eliminated; a
			Front is reduced to a Cadre. On a "@" result, all Police units in the area are neutralized (flip them
			over).</dd>

		<dt>Procedure:</dt>
		<dd>FLN mobile units may move from area to area on the map. Units make their movement attempts singly.
			A unit may move from one area to any other area within its current <i>wilaya</i>. A unit may also move to an
			area in a <i>wilaya</i> adjacent to its current one (that is, the two share a land border) but the area
			moved
			to must be adjacent to at least one area in its current <i>wilaya</i>. Morocco and Tunisia are treated as

	</dl>
	<p>
		The FLN player designates the moving unit and rolls on the Mission Success Table. If the unit is not eliminated
		by the roll on the Table, it is placed in the OC box of the area moved to.
		<i class="note">(Note that the die roll is
			modified by the number of Government units on Patrol in the area moved to, not from. Also, if the
			Government player has not activated the Border Zone that turn, its DRM will not apply to FLN units

		<dd>There is no limit to the number of Harass missions that may be undertaken in an area per turn, but normally
			units attack singly, as discrete
			missions. The exception is when there is at least 1 Failek in the OPS box of an Area: in this case,
			when the FLN player conducts a Harass mission with the Failek, any number of mobile units in the OPS
			box may (but do not have to) join it in its mission, adding all their Firepower Ratings together. All are
			placed in the OC box afterward.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>To conduct the mission, the FLN may 'fire' on the Combat Results Table (CRT) at any 1 Government unit
		(mobile or static) in the same area. The FLN player designates the unit(s) to do the mission and rolls
		on the CRT. The Government unit fired upon may fire back at HALF its Firepower Rating (round fractions
		up). If the FLN unit(s) survived the return fire, place it in the Operations Completed (OC) box.

	<p class="note">Note that one or both player's PSLs will be affected by units being hit, reduced or eliminated; see
		the PSL Adjustments Summary. Also note that Government units are never eliminated, only potentially
		Neutralized.</p>

	<i class="note">This represents a situation where units are broken up into a number of small detachments and
		dispersed in an area to interfere with enemy movement and operations. (The French name for this tactic is

			<ul>
				<li>All units selected to conduct the mission are Elite; or
				<li>A French division (in either mode) is present in the area in any box (it does not have to join the

	<p>
		Airmobilized units (see <a href="#11.12">11.12</a>) may travel any distance to join or conduct a Flush, but only

	<p>
		Total the Contact Ratings of Government units participating in the mission. The Government player rolls to
		contact each FLN unit that is currently in the OPS or OC boxes by rolling equal to or less than this number,
		moving contacted units to one side. (DRM: +1 if target unit has an Evasion rating higher than the total Contact
		ratings
		involved, or Flush is in a Remote area, or if a Terror marker is present; -1 if Flush is in an
		Urban area). Contacted FLN units then fire on the Combat Results Table, and the Government units
		return fire. After taking any combat results, all remaining involved units are placed in the OC box.

	</dl>

	<p>The Government player designates which mobile units in the OPS or PTL box are Reacting. Multiple units may be

		The FLN unit or units that conducted the mission are automatically Contacted, but the FLN player has a
		chance to evade to the UG box. Units roll 1d6 individually, and move to the UG box if they roll equal

		<dt>Procedure:</dt>
		<dd>Elite units may assist in this mission, each one yielding a +1 DRM. There is an additional +1 DRM
			when the "Amnesty" random event is in effect. Government player pays 1 PSP, rolls the die and a number
			of FLN Bands/Faileks in the area equal to the result on the Mission Success Table are neutralized, no
			matter what box they are in (FLN player chooses which exact units are neutralized). The Police units
			remain in the PTL box regardless of the result.</dd>
		<dt>Additional effect:</dt>
		<dd>On a '@' result, all Cadre and Front
			units in the area are neutralized as well and the area is Terrorized (place a Terror marker). On a '+'

		<dd>at least 1 non-neutralized Police unit present; Rural areas only; cost 1 PSP</dd>
		<dt>Procedure:</dt>
		<dd>Success is automatic and permanent: the
			Government player pays 1 PSP and places a 'REMOTE' marker in the area to denote that it is treated as
			Remote for the rest of the game.</dd>
		<dt>Additional effect:</dt>
		<dd>The area is automatically Terrorized
			(place a marker), and the FLN player gains a one-time award of 3d6 PSP. Since Remote areas cannot
			support Fronts, an FLN Front that was in the area is immediately converted to a Cadre. The Government
			player does get the PSP award for so reducing it. The Government
			player is penalized 1 PSP per turn per area he has depopulated in this way, in the Final PSL
			Adjustment Segment of each turn.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p class="note">This represents moving large numbers of peasants out of their traditional villages and into
		government-controlled 'strategic hamlets' where they can be more easily controlled. This does clear portions of
		the
		countryside, thus denying the FLN player a source of supplies and recruits, but it also creates a
		logistical, economic and political strain as the displaced people must be supported in the camps or seek
		shelter in the larger towns and cities. Therefore, the Government player incurs a PSL penalty each
		turn afterwards. Historically, the French resettled over 2 million people, almost a quarter of
		the Muslim population of Algeria.</p>

	<h2>
		<a href="#10" id="10">10. TURN INTERPHASE</a>
	</h2>

	<p>During the Turn Interphase, the following events occur in sequence:

	<h3>
		<a href="#10.1" id="10.1">10.1 CONTROL / DEPRECIATION SEGMENT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Both players examine each area on the map and determine which areas are Controlled and which are Contested.
		Control of an area is adjudged anew each turn as follows: 3 Control Points for each FLN Front or
		Dispersed mode French division, and 1 point for each other unit present in an area. Government units
		do not have to be activated. Neutralized units do not count.
	<p>If one side has twice as many or more Control Points than the other, then it gets Control and an appropriate
		marker is placed in the area. If one side has less than twice as many Points, take the difference of
		the two totals. Both sides then roll 1d6 trying to get equal to or less than that number. If one
		side succeeds, then he gets Control. If both or neither succeed, then the area remains Contested and
		no marker is placed. A side that gets Control of an area keeps it until the beginning of the next
		Control/Depreciation Phase.
	<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> in Mostaganem the FLN has 1 Front and 2 Cadres. The Government has 1 Police and 2
		French Army brigades. Control Point totals are therefore 5 and 3 respectively, and the difference is 2. Both
		sides
		roll 1d6 trying to score 2 or less.

	<h4><a href="#10.11" id="10.11">10.11 Depreciation.</a></h4>

	<p>The Government player must roll to see if any of his Air or Helicopter points are lost due to depreciation (roll
		once for each category, against the Maximum value for each type of point), then the FLN player rolls
		for depreciation of any unused AP he may have had left over after the Operations Phase. (This
		represents inertia, pilfering, losses in transit, capture, sabotage, wear and tear on equipment, and
		apathy on the part of the population - all the things Clausewitz termed 'friction').
	<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> if the FLN player had 17 AP squirreled away, the Loss Number is 4. He will lose 4
		AP if he rolls this number or less on 1d6.

	<h3>
		<a href="#10.2" id="10.2">10.2 RECOVERY SEGMENT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>All neutralized units may attempt to Recover by rolling individually on the Recovery Table. Terrorized areas
		may possibly spontaneously recover in this Segment also (the Government player makes the rolls to
		check if this happens).

	<h3>
		<a href="#10.3" id="10.3">10.3 REDEPLOYMENT SEGMENT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The FLN player returns all his units in a given area to its UG box. The Government player returns all his mobile
		units in a given area from the OC or PTL boxes to its OPS box. The Government player flips all his
		Airmobilized units (<a href="#11.1">11.1</a>) back to their front sides and resets his Air and Helicopter Points
		Available markers to the same boxes as his Air and Helicopter Maximum markers.

	<h3>
		<a href="#10.4" id="10.4">10.4 FINAL POLITICAL SUPPORT ADJUSTMENT SEGMENT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>First, the Government player must check for a coup d'etat if his PSL is less than 30
		(see <a href="#11.3">11.3</a>). Then both sides adjust their PSL as directed in the PSL Adjustment Summary for
		this Phase.

	<h2>
		<a href="#11" id="11">11. SPECIAL RULES</a>
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.1" id="11.1">11.1 AIRPOWER AND AIRMOBILITY</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The Government player may mobilize Air and Helicopter Points. Each point represents a varying number of aircraft
		of various types. He keeps track of these points on the Record Track: each point mobilized adds one to
		the Air (or Helicopter) Point Maximum. The Air (or Helicopter) Point Available marker will help him to
		remember how many points have not been used so far in the turn.

	<h4><a href="#11.11" id="11.11">11.11 Air Points.</a></h4>

	<p>An Air Point may be used any time the Government player rolls on the Combat Results Table. Each Air Point used
		adds +1d6 to the total Firepower rating of the Government units firing. Any number of Air Points (up
		to the amount available) may be used in one combat, but once used they are not recovered until the
		Redeployment Segment. Air Points cannot be used in Urban areas.

	<h4><a href="#11.12" id="11.12">11.12 Helicopter Points.</a></h4>

	<p>Helicopter Points may be used to 'airmobilize' mobile units. One point may airmobilize one Elite brigade; two
		will airmobilize a regular French or Algerian infantry brigade; divisions may not be airmobilized. The
		point or points can be 'attached' to the unit at any time during the turn (so reducing the 'Helo Pts
		Aval' marker on the Record Track), and they 'stay' with the airmobilized unit until the
		Redeployment Segment. Flip the unit over to show its "HELO" side <i class="note">(and note its Contact rating
			has gone up!).</i>
	<p>An airmobilized unit may travel any distance to participate in a Flush or React Mission if it is an Elite unit,
		or if a Division in either mode is present in the area where the mission is occurring.

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.2" id="11.2">11.2 OTHER COUNTRIES</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Under normal circumstances, units of both players may not enter other countries except as noted below.

	<h4><a href="#11.21" id="11.21">11.21 Morocco and Tunisia.</a></h4>

	<p>These two countries are given their independence from France in a random event that occurs during the game
		(or this will occur some time in the first 6 turns, if using optional rules). When these countries are
		granted independence, both the FLN and Government PSL are raised by 2d6 (players roll separately, and
		this happens only once). From that point forward:

	<ul>
		<li>the FLN player may Build or Convert mobile units in that country (at a lower price, too)
			and Move units into or out of Algeria. The Government player may never enter these countries. Note,
			however, that this does not give the FLN player actual control of either country and units there may
			not perform missions other than Build, Convert or Movement.
		<li>The FLN player will, in the Final PSL Adjustment Segment of each turn, gain PSP equal to
			10% (round fractions down) of the firepower of FLN mobile units in Morocco and/or Tunisia.
			<i class="note">(The FLN was interested in maintaining a large military force outside of the country, for it
				would have to be the
				strongest contender for the new government once Algeria gained its independence.)</i>
		<li>The Government player may begin to mobilize the Border Zone to control FLN infiltration
			into Algeria. The effect of the Border Zone is to generate an unfavorable DRM for any FLN units
			attempting Movement missions across the border. The first time the Government player mobilizes the Border
			Zone, they pay the cost in PSP and place the Status marker in the "0" box; each time the Border Zone
			is mobilized after that, the Status markers moves on the track to indicate a higher DRM (-1, -2,
			etc.). Note that the Border Zone must also be activated each turn in order to have any effect. If the
			Government player does not pay the activation cost, flip over the Status marker to show "Inactive" and
			the Border Zone DRM will not apply that turn.
	</ul>

	<h4><a href="#11.22" id="11.22">11.22 France</a></h4>
	<p>No side ever actually controls France. The Government player may not deploy units to France
		<i class="note">(although that is
			technically where his units are coming from)</i> except the OAS marker, if he controls it. The FLN player
		may maintain a maximum of 1 Cadre marker in France (he may place it there in the Deployment Phase,
		from any Area where there is a Front unit not considered an Urban area so any PSP gained or lost in
		the mission are not doubled), where it may perform 1 Propaganda mission per turn <i class="note">(clarification:
			though there are lots of cafes there, France is not considered an Urban area so any PSP gained or lost are
			not doubled).</i> The Government player may not React to this mission. In the Deployment Phase, the Cadre
		unit may be deployed to any Area where there is a Front unit.

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.3" id="11.3">11.3 THE OAS</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The <i>Organization d'Armee Secrete</i> (OAS) was a terrorist organization made up of right-wing white Algerian
		colonists, army deserters, and other hard cases. The OAS is automatically activated in the
		Reinforcement Phase of any turn when the Government PSL is 30 or less. When this event occurs, roll
		one die to see who controls it: on a 1-3 the FLN player, on a 4-6 the Government. In subsequent
		Random Events Phases, roll to see who controls the OAS for that turn. There is a Government PSP
		penalty applied at the end of the turn, depending on where the OAS is placed.
	<p>In the Reinforcement Phase, the controlling player places the OAS marker in any urban area of Algeria or in
		France.

	<ul>
		<li>In Algeria, the OAS marker will automatically conduct one Suppression mission in the
			Operations Phase, at no cost in PSP and no requirement for a Police unit. Whatever the result of the
			mission, it will automatically cause a Terror marker to be placed in the Area (if there isn't one there
			already).
		<li>In France, the OAS marker will generate a +1 DRM when checking for the chances of a coup
			d'etat, and for the results of a coup d'etat when it happens.
	</ul>

	<p>The OAS marker may be removed in the Reinforcement Phase of any turn when the Government PSL is more than
		70. This is the only way to get rid of it: however, it will reappear if the Government PSL goes below
		30 at a later time.
	<p>The Government player will lose PSP in the Final PSL Adjustment Segment of each turn, depending on where the
		OAS is located at the time. See the PSL Adjustments Summary.

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.4" id="11.4">11.4 COUP D'ETAT</a>
	</h3>

	<p>One of the perils of a low Government PSL is the chance that the elite units in the French Army will intervene in
		domestic politics, in hopes of installing a regime more amenable to their wishes. If, at the beginning
		of the Final PSL Adjustment Segment of a turn, the Government PSL is less than 30, the Army may
		attempt a coup. The Government player must roll 1d6 and there is an attempted coup on an adjusted
		"6". The Government player then rolls 2d6 on the Coup Table and applies the result. If the OAS marker
		is currently in France, there is a +1 DRM to both rolls. If the result requires the Government player
		to remove Elite units, they must be removed from the game immediately and completely (they have been
		disbanded and may not be rebuilt). He chooses which ones to remove from among those that are
		already mobilized and on the map; there is no additional penalty if the Coup Table result calls for
		more elite units to be removed than are actually available.

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.5" id="11.5">11.5 TERRORISM</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Terror markers may be placed in areas as a side-effect of Raid, Suppression and Resettlement Missions. There
		may be only 1 Terror marker in an area at a time. When a Terror marker is in an Area, it generally
		makes things more difficult for either side: the FLN player gets fewer AP from an area in the
		Reinforcement Phase, and there are unfavorable DRM for Propaganda, Strike, Flush and Intelligence
		missions. Terrorized areas may recover as a result of successful Civil Affairs missions (<a
			href="#9.25">9.25</a>), or in
		the Recovery Segment (see the Recovery Table).
	<p>The Government player will lose 1 PSP in the Final PSL Adjustment Segment of each turn for each terrorized
		Area, no matter who caused the terror. See the PSL Adjustments Summary.

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.6" id="11.6">11.6 THE FRENCH NAVY</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The Government player may mobilize Naval points. Note the number of points present on the Record Track. The
		effect of Naval points is to interdict FLN AP arriving from abroad: deduct the current number of Naval
		Points from the AP gained by the FLN's current PSL in the Reinforcement Phase, and when the "Foreign
		Arms Shipment" random event occurs. <i class="note">(clarification: unlike Air and Helicopter points, Naval
			points do not depreciate (<a href="#10.11">10.11</a>)).</i>

	<h3>
		<a href="#11.7" id="11.7">11.7 FRENCH DIVISION MODES</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The Government player has a number of division-size units (with a unit size indicator of XX). They are always in
		one of two modes:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Concentrated</b>, where the division is represented by a single counter with a Firepower of
			25; or

		<li><b>Dispersed</b>, where the division is represented by the reverse side of the counter, with a
			blank symbol box and a Firepower of 12 <i class="note">(thus sacrificing firepower for the ability to
				dominate more ground: note the higher Contact Rating).</i>
	</ul>

	<p>Divisions change mode in the Deployment Phase: flip the counter to show whatever mode it happens to be in
		<i class="note">(the unit type of the Division in Concentrated mode does not matter; it's included only for
			historical verisimilitude).</i>
		A neutralized division may change mode, if you think it necessary for some reason.


	<h2>
		<a href="#12" id="12">12 POLITICAL SUPPORT LEVELS AND HOW TO WIN</a>
	</h2>

	<p>The Government and FLN players maintain Political Support Levels (PSL) independently of each other. These levels
		change constantly during the game: see the Charts and Tables for exactly when and by how much.

	<h3>
		<a href="#12.1" id="12.1">12.1 HIGH AND LOW PSL</a>
	</h3>

	<p>There are certain advantages and disadvantages to having a particularly high or low PSL: see the DRM summaries in
		the Charts and Tables.
	<p>If a player's PSL rises to above 99 during the game due to various events, any such "excess" PSP gained for that
		player are not lost: instead they are SUBTRACTED from the other player's PSL.
	<p class="example"><b>>Example:</b> the FLN PSL is currently 98 and the Government player conducts a Population
		Resettlement mission (<a href="#9.26">9.26</a>).
		The FLN player rolls 3d6 and scores 10 PSP. He raises his PSL by one to 99, which is as high as it can go, and
		deducts 9 PSP from the Government PSL.

	<h3>
		<a href="#12.2" id="12.2">12.2 VICTORY</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The game has no pre-set length. If, at any time, either player's PSL is reduced to 0 or less, then the game
		immediately ends and the other player is declared the winner. The scale of that player's victory is
		determined by his PSL at the moment the game ends:

	<ul>
		<li><b>1-25 points: Marginal</b> <i class="note">(That player "wins" the subsequent peace talks, but the
				ordinary population of Algeria is
				not enthusiastic about how either side has behaved, or confident about its future.)</i>
		<li><b>26-50 points: Substantial</b> <i class="note">(That player "wins" the peace talks, but with some kind of
				compromise - for example,
				an Algeria with more independence but significant continued French economic and military presence.)</i>
		<li><b>51+ points: Decisive</b> <i class="note">(That player wins it all - Algeria becomes totally independent,
				with the FLN its
				unchallenged new government; or the spirit of Algerian independence is crushed for another
				generation.)</i>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<a href="#13" id="13">13. OPTIONAL RULES</a>
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a href="#13.1" id="13.1">13.1 SLOW FRENCH REACTION (1954 SCENARIO)</a>
	</h3>

	<p>This rule is for the 1954 scenario only. It is optional but is highly suggested, once players have learned the
		game. Historically, the French authorities were slow to perceive and react to the threat posed by the
		initial FLN actions in November 1954 (the point at which the game begins). They were also slow to
		adopt more effective tactics. Therefore, until the first Reinforcement Phase in which the FLN
		PSL exceeds the Government PSL, these restrictions apply to the Government player:

	<ul>
		<li>he may not mobilize more than 1 mobile unit or Point of any type (Air, Helo, or Naval)
			per turn;
		<li>his infantry divisions may not adopt Dispersed mode;
		<li>he may not perform Civic Affairs, Suppression or Population Resettlement missions.
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a href="#13.2" id="13.2">13.2 MORE DETERMINISTIC INDEPENDENCE (1954 SCENARIO)</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Instead of waiting for a random event to make Morocco and Tunisia independent, assume that this will happen some
		time in the first 6 turns of the 1954 scenario. Each Random Events Phase, roll 1d6; if the number
		rolled is less than or equal to the number of the current turn, the two countries immediately become
		independent.

	<h3>
		<a href="#13.3" id="13.3">13.3 SHORTER GAME.</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Counterinsurgencies can take a long time to conclude: the Algerian War, at about 8 years, was of less than
		average length. Players can agree to an open-ended game, checking their respective PSLs every 6
		turns, at the end of the Turn Interphase. If one player would "win" with at least a Substantial
		Victory (that is, his PSL is 26 or more points ahead of the other player's) two checks running, the
		game ends at that point and he wins the game with the level of victory he enjoyed at that moment.
		However, the game would end if at any point a player's PSL is reduced to 0.
