"Algeria: The War of Independence 1954-1962" is a 2 players wargame simulating the conflict between the FLN Arab
nationalist guerrillas and the French government from 1954 to 1962. During the game, the FLN player tries to erode the
authority of the French colonial authorities and replace their governing structures with his own, to the point that
Algeria makes the transition from being the 10th department of France to national independence.
